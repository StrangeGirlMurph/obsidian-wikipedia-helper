# Obsidian Wikipedia Helper Plugin

A better [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Wikipedia plugin to search, link, insert and open Wikipedia/Wikimedia articles directly from the app and in your notes.

It supersedes the unmaintained Wikipedia plugin with lots of features.

On how to get started and everything else: **Read the [Documentation](https://strangegirlmurph.github.io/obsidian-wikipedia-helper/)!**

## Key Features

- Simple linking of Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikiquote, Wikiversity, Wikivoyage, Wikisource, Wikinews articles in all available languages.
- Opening articles directly in Obsidian (using the Web viewer plugin).
- Inserting a Wikipedia articles description, introduction and thumbnail.
- Using different templates for the inserts.
- Hyperlinking selected text.
- Quicksearching different languages.
- Creating notes for Wikipedia articles.

_Don't worry about this project being "inactive". It's not inactive. It's done :)  
(at least until there aren't any new feature requests)_

I am also happy to hear about your ideas for this plugin and all bugs! Just create an issue! If you want to contribute you can do that simply by creating issues and pull requests :)

## Renaming

The plugin's name used to be "Wikipedia Search". Even though its name has changed its internal ID hasn't for backwards compatibility reasons. You will find it being used in the plugins folder name and in the plugin URL. Just as a heads up so you won't be surprised.
