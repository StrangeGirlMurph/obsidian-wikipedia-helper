# Obsidian Wikipedia Search Plugin

An [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to quickly search for Wikipedia articles and link them in your notes.

## Installation

### From the community plugins list

Note: I am currently still waiting for the merge of my [PR](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/1764) for this plugin to be included in the community plugin list. For now you have to do a manual installation.

1. Search under the Community Plugins in the settings for it and click install.
2. Enable the plugin (from the installed plugin list).

## Demo

Note: OBS didn't record the overlay dropdown menu in the settings. It's there when you use it. I promise :)
