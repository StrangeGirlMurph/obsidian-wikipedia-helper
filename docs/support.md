If you want to support this project you can do so by creating issues with feature request, bug reports and so on, by creating pull requests with fixes and new features and by [supporting me financially](https://www.murphy-in.space/support) by buying me some cake for example :) 

I love to hear about your ideas for the project! Just create an issue and I'll get back to you ASAP.
