# Obsidian Wikipedia Search Plugin

An [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to quickly search for Wikipedia articles and link them in your notes.

## Installation

### From the community plugins list

Note: I am currently still waiting for the merge of my [PR](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/1764) for this plugin to be included in the community plugin list. For now you have to do a manual installation.

1. Search under the Community Plugins in the settings for it and click install.
2. Enable the plugin (from the installed plugin list).

### Manual Installation

1. Create the directory `[path-to-vault]/.obsidian/plugins/wikipedia-search`.
2. Download the `main.js` and `mainfest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/StrangeGirlMurph/obsidian-wikipedia-search/releases) and put them in the created directory.
3. Enable the plugin.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin and enable it.
2. Set your language and format in the settings.
3. Open the command pallet with `CTRL+P` and run `Search Articles`.
4. Search for an article and select the one you're looking for.

## Demo

Note: OBS didn't record the overlay dropdown menu in the settings. It's there when you use it. I promise :)
